F.A.Q.


Why can't we use FITS?
----------------------
FITS is good for images but bad for catalogs.
HDF5 is faster for typical catalog access patterns and far more flexible.
It has its own problems when trying to write multiple things at once.  If you
know a better format let me know.


I really want to save my file in FITS format.
---------------------------------------------
That isn't a question and I don't care, you can't.
