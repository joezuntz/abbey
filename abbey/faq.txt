F.A.Q.


Why can't we use FITS?
----------------------
FITS is good for images but bad for catalogs.
HDF5 is faster for typical catalog access patterns and far more flexible.


I really want to save my file in FITS format.
---------------------------------------------
That isn't a question and I don't care, you can't.
